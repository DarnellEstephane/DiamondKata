IF I had more time, I would:

- Add full '///' comments above the methods for intellisense support.

- Move the input validation/sanitation from the create method to a separate method to separate concerns.

- 

- Make the Diamond class more open for extension by adding either optional startPoint and space parameters or overflow methods to allow for easier re-use later on e.g. Diamonds starting with other letters, containing lowercase letters or even symbols
